# SEvents

A comprehensive Minecraft Bukkit/Spigot plugin library that provides advanced event handling and custom event registration for enhanced gameplay mechanics.

## Overview

SEvents is a powerful Java library designed for Minecraft server plugins that extends the standard Bukkit/Spigot event system with custom events and specialized listeners. It provides developers with a robust framework for handling complex player interactions, entity behaviors, and server mechanics.

### Key Features

- **Custom Event System**: Extended event framework built on top of Bukkit's event system
- **Player Interaction Events**: Comprehensive left/right click handling for blocks, entities, and players
- **Combat Events**: Advanced player vs player and player vs entity combat detection
- **Movement Events**: Detailed tracking of player movement states (jump, sprint, swim, fly, glide, sneak)
- **Equipment Events**: Armor equipping/unequipping detection
- **Fishing Events**: Specialized fishing mechanics with different catch types
- **Projectile Events**: Enhanced projectile impact detection
- **Block Events**: Advanced block interaction and manipulation events
- **Death Events**: Pre-death event handling for players and entities
- **Participation System**: Track entity participation in kills and combat

## Requirements

- **Java Version**: 8 or higher
- **Minecraft Version**: Compatible with Spigot/Bukkit 1.21.3
- **Dependencies**: Spigot API 1.21.3-R0.1-SNAPSHOT

## Installation

## Usage

### Basic Event Registration

```java
import com.ssomar.sevents.SEventFactory;
import com.ssomar.sevents.events.player.click.left.PlayerLeftClickEvent;

// Register custom events
SEventFactory.registerEvent(new PlayerLeftClickEvent());
```

### Event Handling Example

```java
@EventHandler
public void onPlayerLeftClick(PlayerLeftClickEvent event) {
    Player player = event.getPlayer();
    // Handle left click logic
}
